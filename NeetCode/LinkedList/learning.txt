+++ Linked List +++

>>> Linked List Circle --> linkedListCircle.ipynb

--> Given head, the head of a linked list, determine \
if the linked list has a cycle in it.
--> There is a cycle in a linked list \
if there is some node in the list that can be reached again \
by continuously following the next pointer. \
--> Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that \
tail's next pointer is connected to. \
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
--> Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. \
Otherwise, return false.
---
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, \
where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
---
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, \
where the tail connects to the 0th node.
---
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

---
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
---
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
---
Input: head = []
Output: []

>>> Merge Two Sorted Lists --> mergeTwoSortedLists.ipynb
---
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
---
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
---
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Output: true
---
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

>>> Remove Linked List Elements --> removeLinkedListElements.ipynb
---
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
---
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
---
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7

>>> Remove Duplicates from Sorted List --> removeDuplicatesSortedList.ipynb
---
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
---
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

>>> Middle of the Linked List --> middleLinkedList.ipynb
---
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
---
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

>>> Intersection of Two Linked Lists --> intersectionLinkedLists.ipynb
---
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
- Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.
---
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
---
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
