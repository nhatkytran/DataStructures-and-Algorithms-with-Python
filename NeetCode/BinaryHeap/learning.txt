BinaryHeap

--> Complete Binary Tree
--> Max --> Parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
--> Min --> Parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

Using Array
Index --> i
--> Left child --> 2 * i + 1
--> Right child --> 2 * i + 2

Insert
--> Push the value into the values property on the heap
--> Bubble the value up to its correct spot

Priority Queue
--> A data structure where each element has a priority
--> Elements with higher priorities are served before \
elements with lower priorities

BigO of Binary Heaps
--> Insertion - O(logN)
--> Removal - O(logN)
--> Search - O(N)
