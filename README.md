# Algorithms and Data Structures

I am not looking for the shortest solution for a problem
I try to figure out and understand as many solution as possible

...

# Day 15:

1. Combinations

- Understand combination and why its BigO is O(2 \*\* n)
- Use the power of iterator to improve recursive solution
