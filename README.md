# Algorithms and Data Structures

I am not looking for the shortest solution for a problem
I try to figure out and understand as many solution as possible

...

# Day 15:

1. Combinations:

- Understand combination and why its BigO is O(2 \*\* n)
- Use the power of iterator to improve recursive solution

2. Binary Search Rotated

- Find a number in an sorted, rotated array

# Day 16:

1. Permutaions:

- Understand combination

2. Binary Search Rotated

- Recursive implemention
